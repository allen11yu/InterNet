            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>Finding internships can be difficult, especially for undergraduate students who are
              already busy with schoolwork. To mitigate the stress that these students feel, we
              developed a solution for students to easily find tech internships. We want to create
              a fun and interactive way for students to find an internship that matches their
              interests and abilities. Based on the information the applicant inputs into their
              profile, our system will match the applicant with five internships daily. In this
              way, students wonâ€™t have to worry about manually finding internships that fit their
              criterias. Through InterNet, we aim to create a positive experience for
              these students rather than letting internship searching be a burden and to relieve
              the stress of these students during these times. </p>
