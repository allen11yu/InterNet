      <h2>Problem Description</h2>

      <p>
        With thousands of employers posting internships on diverse platforms across various timelines,
        it can be difficult for aspiring professionals to navigate the right opportunity for them.
        Finding internships is difficult, especially for college students interested in technology who are constantly occupied by school.
        It’s difficult to balance between school work and the timely search necessary for finding that ideal internship
        when there’s so much information scattered around the internet in an unorganized manner.
        It would be best if there is a list of available internships with the most important information concisely
        compressed in one place rather than digging around multiple sites for the perfect role.
        For example, this <a href="https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2022-Internships">page</a> sorts out open tech internships, but it isn’t user interactive.
        Therefore, our goal is to combine all the internships out there into a single information system making college students’ life easier.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, there are multiple similar platforms out there such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/">Linkedin</a>,
        <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com">Glassdoor</a>, <a href="https://www.indeed.com/">Indeed</a>, etc. that address this issue.
        However, there’s just too much information on these sites. The large amount of information is sometimes disorganized and hard to filter down.
        Also there aren’t any existing solutions that aim to provide organized internship information for the college students interested in the technology field.
        It makes it difficult and time consuming to search for the exact role one wants.
        We want to make a solution that makes it quick and easy to search for a role for tech students and find the exact deadline.
        We can do this by creating an interactive site that organizes and displays the data in a concise manner,
        making it easier for students to search for a tech internship.

      <h2>Proposed Application</h2>

      <p>
        Our inteded audience are college students who are looking for internship opportunities
        in the role of information technology (ie. SWE Internship, UX Designer Internship, Data Science Internship).
        Recruiters can also access the website and post openings for their companies.
        They can create posts that will let students know of new opportunities and
        add onto the existing database. Users will view information of the companies that are
        offering information technology internship opportunities which will be listed on the website.
        Users will be viewing the opportunities posted by the recruiters, so all data within
        our database is from the recruiters themselves. To add some examples on our site, we will
        use data from this Github <a href="https://github.com/pittcsc/Summer2022-Internships">Repo</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user will first be sent to an onboarding screen where they will be prompted to create a
        profile holding information about their interest in technology, when they want to start an
        internship, location preference, and the types of companies they would be excited to work with.
        Then, the user will be matched with an organized list of tech-related internship opportunities
        aligned with their profile data. Each internship post within the list will be illuminated with
        a short description of the most vital information about the role and the date to apply by.
        This list can be filtered by:
        <ul>
          <li>Application deadlines</li>
          <li>Internship post date</li>
          <li>Location</li>
          <li>Skills-preferred</li>
          <li>Type of opportunity (roles)</li>
        </ul>
        Once the ideal role is found, the user can click a link to the company’s job offering
        website to submit their application.
      </p>

      <p>
        We hope this app will help solve our problem by combining all the tech internships out there
        into a single information system making college students’ life easier.
        By having a matching system, it’ll be quicker and easier for students to search for
        an opening that suits them. Ultimately, having a resourceful website that does the internship
        searching/matching for the students will take a lot of stress out of their busy lives and
        make internship searching a much better experience.
